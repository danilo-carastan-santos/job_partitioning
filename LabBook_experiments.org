* History

** [2021-04-17 sam.]
- The environment was installed (Batsim, BatSched, Evalys, ...)
- The workloads presented the following error:
  - [ISSUE] The profiles "msg_par_hg" was not found on Batsim configuration.
    From its documentation (https://batsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/input-workload.html#profile-types-overview)
    the correct and most similar parameter may be "parallel_homogeneous".

    [SOLUTION] : I replaced the "msg_par_hg" values to "parallel_homogeneous".

  - [ISSUE] I'm not sure if it is an issue, but the workloads begins with:
    {"command": "swf_to_batsim_workload_compute_only.py -v -cs 1e6 -pf 38400 ../workloads/partitioned_test_mustang_release_v0.2.0_66.swf ../workloads/partitioned_test_mustang_release_v0.2.0_66.json", "date": "2020-09-23 17:22:34.608595", "description": "this workload had been automatically generated", "jobs": ...}
    As far as I know, all information before "jobs" should not be there.

    [SOLUTION]: I removed it.
- First simulation:
  After fixing the workload test_mustang_release_v0.2.0_66.json, I kept only 30 jobs in the file, to ran a simple first simulation.
  The small workload is test_mustang_release_v0.2.0_66_small.json and it is in the folder experiments/small_30/
- First analysis:
  I created a simple script running_evalys.py to analyze the jobs.csv output file.
  It plots Gantt Charts regarding the simulation.
